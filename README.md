# QuantumSafe-PQC-Pluggin
The QuantumSafePQCPlugin project is an innovative client-server model designed to secure browser communications with quantum-safe encryption. Leveraging post-quantum cryptography (PQC), specifically the Crystal-Kyber algorithm, this project addresses the emerging threats posed by quantum computing to traditional cryptographic systems.
